# Terminal  Oath authenticator database

Simple Oath authenticator app that keeps stored your service key and allows to easilly access it.
It keeps the keys salted to  avoid having then in a plain file.

## Dependencies
 - oathtool - The actual oathtool that generates the  one time codes
 - openssl  - used to encrypt and decrypt the data

## Usage

YOu can store the salt string in an  eviroment variable `$GSALT`
To store a service key

```
$Â g.sh -a Facebook "ABCD EFGH IJKL MNOP"
Facebook: 123 456
Storing service key
```


To list stored services codes:
```
$ g.sh -l
Facebook: 123 456
Google: 234 567
```

You can also just filter by a single service
```
$ g.sh -l google
Google: 234 567
```

For more options use the -h flag

### Why?
Why have I done this you would ask? Well, I've became quite dependent on Google authenticator as a two factor authentication so when my mobile started breaking down I came to the scenario where I needed to consider moving my google authenticator keys into another mobile. Not only did that became a boring process as I didn't store the actual keys as my replacement phone keep breaking down (That what happens when you pick old mobiles)

So I decided that having a simple terminal aplication with an identical funcionality as the Google Authenticator  was a must.
Do you need this Tool? Probably not, take in consideration you can use `oathtool`  directly and keep your keys safer.
